## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a folder and clone the repositories

```bash
mkdir SudokuGame
cd SudokuGame
git clone https://github.com/quoclong20222428/sudoku-frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/quoclong20222428/sudoku-backend.git
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd sudoku-frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd ../sudoku-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `sudoku-backend` folder. This file is used to store sensitive credentials for JWT token generation and SMTP email services.

**Example `.env` file:**

```env
# Secret key for JWT authentication
SECRET_KEY=your_random_secret_key_here

# SMTP configuration for email verification and password reset
SMTP_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
```

> 🔒 **Important Notes:**
>
> * `SECRET_KEY` can be any long random string. You can generate one using Python:
>
>   ```python
>   import secrets
>   print(secrets.token_hex(32))
>   ```
> * For `SMTP_EMAIL`, use a Gmail account or other SMTP-supported provider.
> * **If you're using Gmail**, you must enable **"App Passwords"** in your Google Account and use that password here. Don't use your normal login password.
> * Never commit the `.env` file to version control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

### 5. Run Backend Server

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 6. Run Frontend

```bash
cd ../sudoku-frontend
npm run dev
```
